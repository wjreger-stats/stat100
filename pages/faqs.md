            you miss as practice on Lon Capa. </i></p>

            Take a screenshot of what you are seeing and describe the problem thoroughly. Remember, there's bound to be computer
            glitches sometimes so try to start your homework early so you don't miss the assignment due date. Again, if you do miss
            the due date because of technical issues, it will just count as a dropped homework. </i></p>

  <div class="card card-body">
    <p>A: <i>The <a href="{{ site.data.info.uiucfinals }}" target="blank">university schedules the finals</a> based on when your class meets- so unless it's an online class, you should not have two finals that overlap unless your other professor isn't using the date that's assigned.

            it uses a partially completed notebook that you fill in during class. There are also weekly Lon Capa assignments
            that are very similar in format to those we do in Stat 100.</i></p>
