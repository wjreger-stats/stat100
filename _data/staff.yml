about: >-
    The Statistics 100 Team is dedicated to helping students on the U of I campus learn and understand basic statistical concepts. We do this in a way that students tell us is both easy to understand and informative!
    <br>
    Stat 100 is unique because we do not teach statistics by memorizing formulas, instead we make sure students understand the concepts and ideas by using our own data taken in class through surveys, a fill in the blank notebook, pre-lectures videos, and a wide variety of tools to help facilitate learning for a large diverse group of students.
    <br>Both the instructors and TAs want you to get the most out of the class and are willing to help in any way that they can. Hope you enjoy your semester with us!

    Hi everyone! My name is Karle and I'm one of the stat 100 instructors. I've always loved math, statistics, and education. Teaching stat 100 is the perfect job for me since I can help students from many different majors gain an appreciation for all 3.<br><br> A few other things about me: I'm a huge Illini fan- I went to school at UIUC, met my husband at UIUC, and now I work here. U of I is one of my favorite places in the world! I also enjoy spending time outside, playing piano, water skiing, snow skiing, and traveling.

    My name is Alex Wang and I graduated in May 2019 with a double major in Statistics and Economics with a minor in Spanish and am now pursuing a Master's of Science in Statistics. I am from the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago and attended William Fremd High School in Palatine. I TA for STAT 100 because it is the first statistics class I took in my life and I enjoyed it a great deal. This course propelled me to eventually major and pursue a Masters in the field. I hope to teach other's STAT 100 so that they enjoy the class as much as I did and come away with as much practical knowledge as possible.. I really like playing basketball in my free time, but I'm always down to play/watch almost any sport. I enjoy being outside and enjoying the weather when it is nice out. When it is raining I enjoy watching shows and movies.
